# Data Liberation

The Data Liberation project envisions a web where your data is truly yours, not locked in closed platforms. Moving to and within WordPress should be an easy, one-click process—whether moving from social networks, from a page builder to core blocks, or shifting from the classic editor to the block editor. 

WordPress will give you powerful tools through 5 development phases to reclaim, manage, and move your content anywhere on the web—no hosting accounts are needed.

Rather than each person or organization needing to figure out a migration pathway, the WordPress community is coming together to provide the tools and guides for *all*. Everyone is welcome to share their knowledge and creations to facilitate others' transitions to WordPress and within WordPress.
