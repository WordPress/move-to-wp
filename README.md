# Data Liberation

The Data Liberation project imagines a more open web where users can seamlessly switch between platforms of their choosing, eradicating the concept of being locked into a system and keeping openness at the forefront. Moving to and within WordPress should be a one-click easy process as much as possible whether moving from social networks, moving from a page builder to core blocks, or shifting from the classic editor to the block editor. 

Rather than each person or organization needing to figure out a migration pathway, the WordPress community is coming together to provide **tools and guides** for us *all* to use to bring folks to WordPress. The outcome will be community-owned plugins and resources accessible for all. Everyone is welcomed to share their knowledge and creations to facilitate others' transitions to WordPress and within WordPress.
